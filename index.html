        <h1>Guessing Game</h1>
        <h2>A little bit about me</h2>
        <p> Hello My name is Sage Jasinski. Shortly after an early graduation of highschool I went to Bellevue college for a short time to get general class complete before I left to serve a church mission for 2 years.
             Although you can go anywhere in the world, I was assigned to Indiana, Ohio, and Kentucky where I helped better the community
              and served full time away from family and friends. After my 2 years was up I attended Brigham Young University to pursue a 
              bachelors in mechanical engineering. Unfortunately when COVID hit my wife and I lost our jobs at a hotel and I could no 
              longer afford schooling or housing which prompted us to move back to washington and restart our professional lives. 
              Through connections I had made I got a job as a QA tester and shortly after became a Testing Team Lead and logistics 
              manager for the products we were asked to test.A good family friend who graduated from code fellows a couple years ago, 
              saw some hobby projects I was coding and introduced me to Code fellows. Seeing his enthusiasm for the program and hearing 
              how it changed his life I soon got in contact with an advisor and have loved every second of it. My goals for after 
              Code fellows is to get a solid job in the tech industry that will allow me to work on meaningful projects.
